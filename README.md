# PersonalityQuizGuide

## This repository was intended to be used by those following the video guide found here: https://youtu.be/61R5LUIAScM

The video and this code is intended to help those who wish to make a personality style quiz. As discussed in the video, there are many ways you can write one and this uses a very simple linear scale for determining the result. Most personality style quizzes will use a 'most common answer' approach.

This is intended as a guide but not a final solution, as some students in the Code First: Girls course will be using this as a basis of their final projects. Please contact for any questions or happily fork this repo and 'finish' the project.
